# Welcome to Learn JavaScript!

I am thrilled you decided to join the course!

**Learn JavaScript is going to be one of the best investments you made** this year. Itâ€™ll help you *build anything from scratch*, *remember JavaScript* for life, and *code without copy-pasting* from google.

I can't wait to help you learn JavaScript.

First things first.

**I want to to understand where you're at**, so I know how to best help you. Please take some time and tell me why you joined Learn JavaScript.
