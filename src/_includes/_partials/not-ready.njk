Hi, I'm not done writing this article yet. I apologize for wasting your time coming to this page.

I linked to this page because I wanted to try a new way to speed up my writing process â€” where I create pages for topics I'd like to talk about in advance. This lets me create a page without worrying about updating links from posts I've published before.
